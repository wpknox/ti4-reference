### Purpose

This project's purpose is to serve as an online rules reference for the popular board game: Twilight Imperium 4th Edition by Fantasy Flight Games.

TI is my favorite board game, but as many people know, getting a group of people together to play a game that can take 8+ hours consistently can be quite difficult. So, when my friends and I *were* able to play TI, we would often forget many of the rules and/or subtle interaction in the game and we would have to spend vast amounts of time looking at the rules reference to resolve conflicts.

The end goal of this application to allow for a user to be able to search for a rule so they can quickly and accurately resolve potential questions that will come up over the course of a TI game.

___

The second goal of the project is to serve as a reference for each individual race in Twilight Imperium 4th Edition, including the races that come with the Prophecy of Kings expansion.

This will allow users of the website to be able to see what each race starts with and potentially different strategies for each race. Though the strategies would be a later goal.
___

Another goal of this project to serve as a hub for being able to reading the lore of the Twilight Imperium universe and the lore of all of the races within it.

### Potential Expansions

This project could eventually be expanded upon to provide users suggestions on how to play different races, generate random boards for a given number of players, and even more in-depth ideas such as suggestions on how to play *against* different races depending on a user's selected race. These are not the primary function of the project and would be looked into as an afterthought.

I personally have not played enough TI to currently be able to provide these suggestions, but more experience and leveraging community ideas would be likely.

### File Information

All information found on this project is readily available either on the TI4 wiki or in the books that come with the game itself. All data will be stored in JSON files in the `/json` directory.
